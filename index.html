          I'm a recent graduate of the School of Code, a 16-week intensive
          software development bootcamp. A puzzle-addict since childhood and
          lover of automation, I'm passionate about technology and its potential
          to improve people's lives.

            Why am I attracted to the Trainee Software Tester position at

            I'm drawn to the Trainee Software Tester position at Resonate
            because of the company's focus on innovation and its mission to
            shape the future of transport in a way that reflects the evolving
            needs of our society. As someone who is passionate about technology
            and its potential to improve people's lives, I'm excited by the
            prospect of contributing to such meaningful work.
          </p>
          <p>
            My previous experience working for a member of the House of Commons
            gave me a firsthand understanding of the critical importance of
            effective transport links and data on communities. I believe that my
            experience has prepared me well for the role of Trainee Software
            Tester, and I'm eager to leverage my skills to make a positive
            impact in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly impressed by Resonate's commitment to diversity and
            inclusivity, and I believe that a diverse team can drive innovation
            and success. I'm excited to work for a company that values these
            principles, and I'm especially inspired by the fact that Resonate
            has a female CEO. It's great to see a woman leading the way in such
            a dynamic and forward-thinking company.

            Why is Software Testing important - if developers write perfect

            Software testing is an essential part of the software development
            process. It helps to ensure that the software is of high quality,
            reliable, and meets user requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if there was such thing as a perfect developer, testing can
            pick up on performance issues, ensure that the software is working
            reliably, and can even be used to guide and define the needs of a
            project when used in Test Driven Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Testing also helps to ensure that the software is accessible to
            everyone, and that it meets the needs of all users. It can also help
            to identify and fix bugs before they are released to the public.
          </p>

            Finally, and most importantly, the dopamine rush of seeing all that
            green text is just really, really great.

            I'm an ambitious person who is driven by a thirst for knowledge and
            logical problem-solving. I tend to naturally gravitate towards
            leadership, but I don't want to stop coding. I'm aiming to grow into
            a developer who can lead a team, mentor junior developers, and
            contribute to the design and architecture projects.

            You may be familiar with the concept of a “T” shaped person; someone
            who has a breadth of knowledge or skill, but specialises in one
            area. At the moment, I’m more of a hyphen shape - I’ve always been a
            jack of all trades, and School of Code has given me a broad
            knowledge and interest in development. I’m looking for a role where
            I can start specialising and really gain that depth of experience.
            (Eventually, I'd like to become an upside-down U, or perhaps an E on
            its side.)

            I do like to think of life, like good software development, as
            iterative. Though I have an overall goal and vision, I am always
            open to change and new opportunities. For that reason, I admire
            companies that, to some extent, allow their developers to explore
            and learn new skills.
